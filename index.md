I am a nomad, musician, and engineer exploring smooth space through virtual synthesis.

I have over a decade of experience in music production and sound design. Currenty, I am focused on developing instruments and tools for exploring new concepts in music.

Aside from music, I also enjoy literature and philosophy. I've presented and sat on panels at the University of St Francisâ€™ Writers Conference on a few occasions. I also have experience in graphic design and organizing lighting for live performance.

Currently I am living a nomadic life traveling across the United States, but occasionally you can find me residing in lovely Chicago.
